        "The problem itself is analogous to the 1/0 Knapsack Problem as we can imagine our day as our Knapsack that we want to pack as many activities in as possible while maximizing the amount of profit. The day is the sack, and the activity is a stolen good. The cost of each a tivity is unlike in the Knapsack problem the weight, but the time an activity can take. As such that is also what our overarching constraint's unit: time rather than weight capacity. \n",
        "We use the 1/0 Knapsack Problem because we cannot do an activity half way and have to include full activities rather than fractional pieces of activities. \n",
        "\n",
        "Cormen et al. (2009) agrue for a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem rather than a greedy algorithm. That is because the greedy algorithm's assumption of an optimal local choice contributing to the optimal solution does not hold here because we may not be optimizing our capacity usage. The dynamic programming solution however can with a complexity of $O(n T)$ where n is the number of activities and T is the maximum time we can have in the day.\n",
        "\n",
        "To solve this strategy we need to break down the activity of scheduling task to whether we can increase our profit if we include a particular task or not. Including a particular activity changes depending on how much capacity has been already used in the schedule and how many a ctivities have been added. However, we have the same case of the e.g. 2 activities being included already and capacity being reduced by 2 hours already, we can memoize these problems to make use of overlapping substructure. \n",
        "\n",
        "To create the activity scheduler it would be most helpful to \"pack\" an activity into one unit, that is an object of class activity. This is more memory efficient than storing them in an array and makes it easy to organize the activities. \n",
        "\n",
        "To finally print the activity schedule we can adopt the tracing and printing strategy that was used when reconstructing the longest common subsequence using dynammic programming."

        "The DP programming solution is highly computationally efficient by having complexity $O(n T)$ and also has the same spacial complexity as it just needs create the matrices of that size. Creating the auxiliary matrices and backtracking it for the ultimate schedule creating adds to the cost but does not change the worst case run time. There is no difference in the best vs. the worst case time complexity because in either way the entire matrix is constructed and traced back regardless. \n",
        "\n",
        "Also note the previously mentioned importance of the unit of $T$. The more fine-grained the scheduler should work, the quicker its complexity will skyrocket. Say, I want to schedule three activities within 5 hours and each of their length is given in hours then we can have only 5 columns in the matrix, but if suddenly the activities had length in minutes say 30, 120, and 270 minutes, we would need to change T from 5 h to 300 min, thereby greatly increasing the complexity of the scheduler. \n",
        "\n",
        "The brute force solution on the other hand is incredibly inefficient as it has to make $O(\\sum_{r = 1}^{r = n}{(\\frac{n!}{(n - r)!*r!})})$ comparisons between the different schedules. This happens in the best and in the worst case because even if the best solution is the first one to be encountered, all solutions will be checked. Space wise, it will produce an increasingly longer list of to_be_checked schedules that grows with the same complexity as the complexity.\n",
        "Especially space becomes an issue really quickly which is why the maximum number of activities my machine could handle was at around 20. That is because $O(\\sum_{r = 1}^{r = n}{(\\frac{n!}{(n - r)!*r!})})$ lists have to be stored for comparisons.\n",

        "A strength of this algorithm is its obvious superiority both in run time and space complexity compared to a brute force approach. It is much more efficient on both metrics.\n",

        "A weakness of the DP approach is that it can only identify one unique solution in terms of the schedule outputs. That is, if slightly adjusted, the brute force algorithm would be able to output every combination that leads to the optimal output if there are for example two optimal combinations. The dynamic approach of tracing back from the top right corner reconstructs the best schedule backwards which means that the schedule outputted is input dependent if there are two different schedules that are possible. This is why in my brute force vs. dynammic programming check above, we had to compare simply the profits not the actual schedule. The chance of multiple schedules being optimal increases with the number of unique profits and lengths of activities. \n",
        "\n",
        "The weakness of unit dependency is described in the complexity analysis. This dependency, however, also has direct implications on the practical inputs that are allowed in the scheduler because the length of an activity has to be a whole number as the numpy array used to memoize the schedule cannot have \"partially filled\" cells.
